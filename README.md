# Rain App

Simple React app that uses the client's location to retrieve weather and forecast data.

I originally wanted an input field so one can enter a zip code and retrieve weather data that way, but the service I'm using requires a server to that. I didn't want to create a backend for this, as the original intent was to learn and explore React.

Uses OpenWeather and Google's Geocoding API for weather and location services.
Note: You need your own API key to use those services.

App was created using React Bootstrap. Run 'npm start' to start the app.

## Backlog
- Add Redux (under development)
- Allow user to enter location
- Prettier UI
- Use a different set of icons
- Adjustable forecast
- Hourly forecast
- Weather alerts
